## [Unreleased]

### Added 

- `String` literals and variables
- `Int.toString()` and `Int.toFloatString()`
- `StringBuilder` for gas-efficient string building
- Global compile-time `ton` function that conversts string to Int during compile time.
- `checkDataSignature` similar to func `check_data_signature`
- `String.asComment` for conversion text to a comment payload
- `Resumable` trait, allows to resume contract operations once it was stopped

### Changed
- `contractAddress` now accepts single argument of type `StateInit` and always produces address for workchain. Old method is renamed to `contractAddressExt`.
- `hashCell` and `hashSlice` are now extension function `hash` on `Slice` and `Cell`
- Removed some keywords such as `message`, `contract`, `init` to allow use this names as variable names
- Renamed `receiveBounced` to `bounced`

### Fixed

- Fixing importing tact with providing extension, now `import "./lib";` and `import "./lib.tact";` are equivalent.
- Fixing extension function generation
- Fixing clashing of variable names with func primitives and global functions
