## [Unreleased]

- Global compile-time `ton` function that conversts string to Int during compile time.
- `checkDataSignature` similar to func `check_data_signature`
- `String.asComment` for conversion text to a comment payload

### Changed
- `contractAddress` now accepts single argument of type `StateInit` and always produces address for workchain. Old method is renamed to `contractAddressExt`.

### Fixed
